This is not a completed project and consists of several subprojects.

First, some history: I like to write, and I have enough of a perfectionist streak
that the current crop of "book creators" (generally Calibre for changing between
formats, or Scrivener to write in and then format through) do not give me the
powertools I, personally, require. 

Each separate bit will be, well, separate, with this generator to tie things
together.
